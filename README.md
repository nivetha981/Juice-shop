# Juice-shop

**Juice Shop Website**  

I developed a fully responsive **Juice Shop Website** using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap**. This project includes:  
- **Home Page:** Showcasing the shop's offerings with an attractive design.  
- **About Us Page:** Providing details about the juice shop's background and values.  
- **Contact Us Page:** Including a contact form for customer inquiries.  
- **Product List Page:** Displaying various juice flavors with descriptions and pricing.  
- **Logo Design:** Custom-designed logo to enhance branding.  
- **Form Handling:** Implemented form validation and data handling for customer inquiries.  
- **GitHub Repository:** The project is hosted on GitHub for easy access and version control.  

This project demonstrates my skills in **frontend development, UI/UX design, and form validation**. ðŸš€
